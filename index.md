## Abstract

(~ 2000 characters)

The project idea is to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) where users can upload pictures of their houseplants. The application will then provide the scientific name of each plant and information on how often they should be watered.

More specifically, from the client side (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), users can:

Upload pictures.
Access a section with all their saved plants.
Receive notifications when itâ€™s time to water.
The server side, written in Node.js, will handle communications with the API for image classification.

The data will be stored locally.
