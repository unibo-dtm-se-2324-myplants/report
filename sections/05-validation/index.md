## Validation

### Testing Process (What should have been done)

If testing had been fully implemented for **PlantAI**, the process could have followed these steps:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
   - **Why**: TDD ensures that tests are written before actual code, enforcing that features are implemented to pass predefined criteria.
   - **Process**: For each feature (e.g., plant identification, care instructions), a corresponding test would be written first, and then the feature would be developed to pass the test.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - The ideal goal would have been to cover all major functionalities of the app, including:
     - Image upload and plant identification.
     - Correct retrieval and display of care instructions.
     - Notification system for watering reminders.
     - Offline functionality testing (service workers).
   - Achieving **80%+ code coverage** would be a realistic goal to ensure reliability.

3. **Success Rate**:
   - If tests were implemented, we would aim for a high success rate (90%+), meaning most tests should pass on every code commit, ensuring stability.

### Acceptance Testing

1. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - The tests should validate whether the app meets the following user requirements:
     - Accurate identification of plant species.
     - Proper functionality of the care reminders.
     - Seamless offline access and data retrieval.
   - The tests would also verify the integration of features like MongoDB for data storage.

2. **Acceptance Test Outcomes**:
   - If executed, acceptance tests would confirm whether the app aligns with all user stories and functional requirements.
   - A final report would be generated to document any failed tests or unmet requirements, providing a clear roadmap for improvement.
