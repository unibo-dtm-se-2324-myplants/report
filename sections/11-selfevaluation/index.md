# Self-Evaluation

## Role in the Project

As a solo developer of **PlantAI**, I was responsible for the full development lifecycle of the project. My primary responsibilities included:

- **Backend Development**: Designing and implementing the Node.js server, including setting up the API routes and handling image processing with the OpenAI API.
- **Frontend Development**: Building the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring it was user-friendly and responsive.
- **Service Worker Implementation**: Adding offline capabilities through service workers to enhance the Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Setting up and automating the testing and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions.
- **Version Control**: Managing the project repository on GitHub, including using Git for version control and following conventional commit practices.

## Strengths

- **Comprehensive Understanding of the Project**: Since I handled all aspects of the project, I developed a strong understanding of the entire system, from backend logic to frontend UI.
- **Learning and Application of New Technologies**: Throughout the development process, I learned and applied various new technologies, such as the OpenAI API for image recognition and service workers for offline capabilities. I am particularly proud of mastering these technologies and integrating them into the project.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: I encountered several challenges, particularly with deployment to Vercel and handling asynchronous API calls. I worked through these issues systematically, learning from both mistakes and successful implementations.
- **Commit to Quality**: I followed best practices for version control (using Git), ensuring that the codebase remained clean, modular, and maintainable.

## Weaknesses

- **Initial Struggles with Branching**: While I used Git for version control, I initially struggled with incorporating proper branching strategies. I relied more on local backups instead of leveraging the full potential of branches for feature development. This slowed my workflow in the beginning, though I eventually improved my use of Git.
- **Vercel Deployment Issues**: One of the significant weaknesses of the project is that I couldnâ€™t fully deploy the application on Vercel due to integration challenges with the service worker and OpenAI API. If I had more experience with serverless deployment or had chosen a framework like **Next.js** earlier, the deployment process would have been smoother.
- **Time Management**: As the only developer, I found myself balancing multiple tasks (backend, frontend, deployment, report). At times, I struggled to dedicate enough time to certain areas, which led to delays in implementing certain features, and presenting the final project.

## Future Improvements

If I were to start over or continue developing **PlantAI**, I would:
- Use **Next.js** for better server-side rendering and improved deployment workflows, which would mitigate the issues I faced with Vercel.
- Improve my use of Git branching strategies from the start, making the development process more efficient.
- Allocate more time to testing and deployment to ensure the application works seamlessly across all environments.

In conclusion, I am proud of the work I accomplished with **PlantAI**. Despite some challenges, the project allowed me to grow as a developer and provided me with valuable experience in full-stack development, version control, and continuous integration. I have learned a lot from this project and feel more confident in tackling future technical challenges.
