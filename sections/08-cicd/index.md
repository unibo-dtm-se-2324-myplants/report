## CI/CD

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Workflow

The **CI/CD** pipeline for PlantAI ensures that all code changes are automatically tested and deployed, streamlining development and minimizing manual intervention.

### Automation

- **Automated Testing**: Each code push triggers automated tests to ensure new code doesnâ€™t break existing features.
- **Build & Deploy**: After passing tests, the app is automatically built and deployed to the selected environment (e.g., Vercel or another platform).

### Why?

- **Consistency**: Automating the process reduces the chances of human error, ensuring reliable deployment.
- **Faster Deployment**: New features and bug fixes can be deployed to production quickly.
- **Scalability**: As the project grows, the CI/CD pipeline ensures the app can handle increased complexity.
