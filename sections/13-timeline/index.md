# Step by Step

## Demo e Organization

1. I created a demo of the project I had in mind
2. After the approval I created the organization
3. I forked my demos
4. I inizialized the Artifact and Report repositorys on the organizzation

## Working on the demo

1. Add .gitignore (node, windows, git and .env [i will put my openai key in an .env file so it's not pushed on puiblic org repo]) and .gitarrtibutes
2. Install all the dipendence: npm install express openai dotenv multer and node.js (npm init -y)
3. Import demo on Artifact repo

Road map:

- Solve visualization problems with OpenAI answer
- Handle non-plant image uploads
- Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Storage
- Implement notification functionality
- Enable picture uploads from phone cameras
- Better responsive UI

Problems encouterd:
